===============================

                     My name's Casey, I'm 23 live in Columbus, Ohio. I have a business idea to creating my own social network. I have taken about a year and a half to create my social network so try and make it the best social network out there.I been trying to get my social network launch for 3 months now but I don't know the right people and I don't know exactly what I'm doing, so if you can help please let me know asap…..so if you could help out so I can get my first major business off the ground and started please let me know asap…..i plan to describe what makes my social network different than Facebook and twitter exc. once i could meet in person I don't trust just writing my ideas over email or scanning my ideas and sending them  so once again I could really use your help  Thank you for reading Casey Parsons ps we all seen how Facebook just took off out of nowhere and I'm hopping my social network does the same and with the ideas I have for my Social network I think its more than likely it will. I'm also willing to change little things if you have suggestions if we work together  thank you once again   i live in columbus ohio, I hope we can meet up soon to talk about becoming partners on my social network and launching it as a demo first and see what reactions it gets. if positive then we can launch the entire site and make a huge difference in the social network work. so please if your interest in going in on social network with me please contact me asap    thank you  Casey Parsons   caseyparsons1990@gmail.com
